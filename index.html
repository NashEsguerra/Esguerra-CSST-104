        <h3>Courses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Programming Languages: Courses focusing on programming languages like Python, Java, C++, and others are fundamental. These courses cover syntax, data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.</li>
            <li>Web Development: Web development courses teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Angular. They cover front-end and back-end development, databases, and server-side scripting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="data-science">Data Science</h2>
        <h3>Data Science Courses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Introduction to Data Science: The course begins with an overview of the data science process, including data acquisition, cleaning, exploration, analysis, and interpretation.</li>
            <li>Statistical Analysis: Students learn basic statistical concepts and techniques for analyzing data, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.</li>
            <li>Data Wrangling: This section covers techniques for data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation to prepare raw data for analysis. Topics include data cleaning, missing value imputation, data normalization, and feature engineering.</li>
            <li>Data Visualization: Students learn how to visualize data using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. Topics include plotting histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to explore and communicate insights from data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h2>
        <h3>Machine Learning Courses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Introduction to Machine Learning: The course begins with an overview of machine learning concepts, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Students learn about the basic components of a machine learning system and the types of problems that machine learning can address.</li>
            <li>Regression: Students learn about regression analysis, a supervised learning technique used for predicting continuous outcomes. Topics include linear regression, polynomial regression, regularization techniques, and model evaluation metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.</li>
            <li>Classification: This section covers classification algorithms, which are used for predicting categorical outcomes. Topics include logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and ensemble methods like random forests and gradient boosting.</li>
            <li>Clustering: Students learn about unsupervised learning techniques for clustering similar data points together. Topics include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering, and evaluation metrics such as silhouette score and Davies–Bouldin index.</li>
            <li>Dimensionality Reduction: This section covers techniques for reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving important information. Topics include principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and manifold learning techniques.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="quantitative-methods">Quantitative Methods</h2>
        <h3>Quantitative Methods Courses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Descriptive Statistics: This section covers techniques for summarizing and describing data using statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, and percentiles. Students learn how to calculate these measures and interpret them in context.</li>
            <li>Probability Theory: Students learn about the fundamentals of probability theory, including basic concepts such as sample spaces, events, probability distributions, and random variables. Topics include probability rules, conditional probability, independence, and Bayes’ theorem.</li>
            <li>Regression Analysis: Students learn about regression analysis, a statistical technique used for modeling the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. Topics include simple linear regression, multiple regression, model estimation, and interpretation of regression coefficients.</li>
            <li>Time Series Analysis: This section covers techniques for analyzing time-series data, which consists of observations collected at regular intervals over time. Topics include trend analysis, seasonal variation, autocorrelation, and forecasting methods such as moving averages and exponential smoothing.</li>
            <li>Decision Analysis: This section covers techniques for making decisions in uncertain situations. Topics include decision trees, utility theory, risk analysis, sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation.</li>
